# Money-Tracker-App
A web app to record users' financial income and expenses, my job is as a Cloud Engineer to deploy the application using Google Cloud. Tools and technology used are App Engine and Cloud SQL.

## Previous URL*:
### Front-End: 
https://frontend-dot-submission-mgce-mrazinsyakib.et.r.appspot.com/ (Deployed with App Engine)
### Back-End: 
http://34.101.227.37:8000/ (Deployed with Compute Engine from Cloud SQL instance) 

*) This project was previously deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but it is currently inaccessible due to limitations on my GCP account that necessitated the removal of this project. However, this project can still be redeployed using a new GCP project.
